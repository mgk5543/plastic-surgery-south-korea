            <p>It was around 1945 that there were no plastic surgery techniques available in Korea (Korean society of plastic and reconstructive surgeons). Doctors at the time had never heard the term “plastic surgery”. Nonetheless, after independence, the entry of Western doctors into Korea had brought the opportunity for Korean doctors to be able to access Western journals and different medicines such as sulfa drugs and penicillin. At that time, the term “plastic surgery” was still not mentioned but there are still many documents written about Western doctors performing skin grafts on patients with facial and finger disfigurement and contracture due to severe and chronic necrosis of the skin, skin defects, and burns.</p>

            <p>In 1950, the Korean War broke out, a lot of doctors from the US and UN were mobilized to cure injured patients, and began active treatment of injured patients (Korean society of plastic and reconstructive surgeons). Among them, the US military doctors Dr. Millard and Dr. Stenstrom had arrived in Busan, they applied various plastic surgery techniques including reconstruction. However, they just concentrated only on their duties and did not intend to develop plastic surgery in Korea.</p>

            <p>Plastic surgery has become so common that an estimated 30 percent of Korean women aged 20 to 50 had surgical or nonsurgical cosmetic procedures last year, with many having more than one procedure. In an effort to improve their beauty, 20 percent of women between the ages of 19 and 49 in Seoul, the country’s capital city, admitted they had gone under the knife. Three in every four Korean women aging from 20-30 have undergone plastic surgery and the double eyelid surgery is the most performed one on women in this country.</p>

        <h3>THE STIGMA</h3>
        <p>Arguing against the idea that Koreans have uniquely vain and harsh standards of beauty, Leem said this rationale fails to comprehend Korea’s “enthusiasm for education, self-improvement and enhancement.”“Plastic surgery is not just about being ‘normal’ or ‘passable,’ but about moving forward and being ‘above normal’ for Koreans,” she said. “Compared to Koreans’ obsession with education or religion, the plastic surgery boom is almost nothing.” The simplistic understanding of plastic surgery as oppressive and singular to Korea is wrong, Leem said, and demonizing these procedures “stops consumers of plastic surgery from talking about their motivations, satisfactions, concerns, anxieties and hopes in open spaces.” G, for one, has no regrets about her cosmetic procedures and believes that the changes to her appearance have noticeably benefited her as a member of society. “There is definitely a part of me that can increase my confidence by making sure that I look as good on the outside as I do on the inside,” G said. “Many people say that what’s on the inside is more important than outer beauty, but I don’t think it has to be so separated.” When some people think about plastic surgery, they often imagine the worst-case instances, extreme transformations with very unflattering results. Others may just dismiss the idea as simply a vanity pursuit, something for "other people" trying desperately to conform to societal ideals of beauty. The word 'plastic' has itself conjured up the notion of ridiculously over-sized breast implants or unnatural looking faces, lacking all expression according to many people that have discussed this with Dr. Wirth over the years. However, plastic surgery has become more common than you might think. The best cosmetic work is that which is more subtle, enhancing natural features that already exist and providing more self-confidence to the individual.

        <h3>EUROCENTRIC BEAUTY STANDARDS?</h3>
        <p>"The misconception that, 'Koreans just want to look white,' is a symptom of western arrogance and Eurocentrism and has no basis in reality," Leung told Business Insider. "Pale skin has always been a standard of beauty not only in East Asia but all of Asia, based on the implication that the lighter the skin the less one was in the sun working outdoors." Common procedures beyond eyelid surgery, nose jobs, and skin whitening are also aimed at achieving specifically Korean beauty standards, not Western, according to Leung. Many Western critics, plastic surgeons included, have taken the prevalence of these procedures to mean that Koreans desire to look more Caucasian or white. Only about 50% of East Asians have "double eyelids," while it is widespread among Caucasians. But Alfred "Haeppy" Leung, a Seoul-based YouTuber with WeFancy, a channel that examines Korean culture, believes that this is a major misconception about plastic surgery in South Korea. "For example, Koreans like slimmer jawlines while Westerners like stronger jawlines. Westerners like higher protruding cheekbones while Koreans tend to like flatter cheekbones. Koreans tend not to like very thick and full lips, while lip fillers are considered a standard procedure in western cosmetic surgery," Leung said. </p>

        <h3>PLASTIC VS COSMETIC</h3>
        <p>Reconstructive surgery is also commonly carried out on people who may have been disfigured in an accident or due to illness or on those who have been born with a deformity. A key component that Dr. Wirth highlights is that we are a specialty that does cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. "Many people just don't understand that Board Certified Plastic Surgeons do work in Microsurgery, Burn, hand, congenital defects, and more as well as the better-known cosmetic surgery." Says Dr. Wirth. Cosmetic surgery is a unique discipline of medicine focused on enhancing appearance through surgical and medical techniques. Cosmetic surgery can be performed on all areas of the head, neck and body. Because treated areas function properly but lack aesthetic appeal, cosmetic surgery is elective. Plastic surgery is defined as a surgical specialty dedicated to reconstruction of facial and body defects due to birth disorders, trauma, burns, and disease. Plastic surgery is intended to correct dysfunctional areas of the body and is reconstructive in nature.

        <h3>THE CULTURE</h3> <p>In my opinion, I feel like the only toxic thing about plastic surgery in South Korea is the culture surrounding it. Women, even at young ages, are always told to get work done, simply because there are not "pretty" enough. Now, plastic surgery is embedded within urban South Korean culture. It’s not uncommon for high school students to receive cosmetic surgery as a graduation present, and there are numerous apps, YouTube videos and blogs available to help people select the clinic and physiological redesign that’s right for them. Still, the social pressure to be “above normal” comes with its own negative consequences. One young woman, Ashley Kim, emphasized the unhealthy cost of this mindset, recalling her family’s recurring comments on her appearance as a child and their advice for getting plastic surgery — such as, “Why don’t you get your eyes done?” or “No one will marry you with a nose like that” or “You must look this way to get a job.” This demeaning, however not all instances are like this. Sometimes, women do it simply because of the normalization, and the culture being different from more westernized views of "natural beauty." Growing up, I was always told from other people that getting plastic surgery is wrong, and that we should learn how to embrace our natural selves. Then, on the other hand, my relatives have all gotten work done on their eyes, noses, or lips, and I think that it is completely fine. The culture is entirely different which is completely fine, the only thing that is unacceptable is the degrading and negative remarks toward impressionable young adults that are pressured into getting work done.
